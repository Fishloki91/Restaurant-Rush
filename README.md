### v2.0.0 - Major Gameplay & UX Overhaul

**Gameplay Balance:**
- **Staff Fatigue Rebalance:** Changed fatigue-to-performance ratio from 1:2 to 1:5, reducing max performance penalty from 50% to 20%. Staff now maintain better efficiency even when fatigued, making the game more forgiving while still encouraging rest management.

**Staff of the Day System:**

- **Visual Improvements:** Changed efficiency bonus displays from large bars to compact badge-style boxes for cleaner presentation.

**Customer Satisfaction Dashboard:**
- **Complete Overhaul:** Redesigned the satisfaction page into a comprehensive dashboard with:
  - Large visual satisfaction meter with emoji feedback
  - 8 key metrics in grid layout: Happy Customers, Unhappy Customers, VIP Served, Avg Wait Time, Success Rate, Today's Orders, Avg Order Value, and Performance Rating
  - Dynamic performance ratings (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor) based on multiple factors
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy and easier data scanning
  
**User Experience:**
- **Notification Management:** Toasts/notifications are now disabled when viewing menus or modals, preventing distractions during important decisions.
- **Reduced Visual Clutter:** Removed hover animations on cards for a calmer, more static interface while keeping button animations for interactive feedback.
- **Mobile Optimization:** 
  - Improved satisfaction dashboard layout for small screens (single column on mobile, 2 columns on tablets)
  - Better touch targets and readability
  - Streamlined menu system to avoid popup clutter
