# Restaurant Rush - v1.2.0 Update

## Major Feature: Multi-View Navigation System

Say goodbye to scrolling! The game now features a clean, modern navigation system with separate views for each section of your restaurant management dashboard.

**How It Works:**
- Start from a central overview showing key stats at a glance
- Click "View Details" on any card to dive into that section
- Each section (Orders, Staff, Inventory, Satisfaction) has its own dedicated view
- Use "Back to Overview" buttons or press ESC to return to the main dashboard
- Smooth transitions between views for a seamless experience

**Benefits:**
- No more scrolling through long pages to find information
- Focus on one aspect of your restaurant at a time
- Better use of screen space with responsive layouts
- Cleaner, more organized interface
- Faster access to the information you need

Manage your restaurant with ease using the new multi-view system!

## Quality of Life Improvements

### 1. Quick Stats Overview Cards
The main dashboard now displays large, easy-to-read overview cards for each section. At a glance, see:
- Total active orders and how many are urgent
- Number of available staff members
- Items running low on stock
- Current customer satisfaction percentage

These cards give you instant situational awareness without diving into details!

### 2. Visual Notification Badges
Important alerts are now impossible to miss! Overview cards display prominent notification badges when:
- Orders are becoming urgent (30 seconds or less remaining)
- Inventory items drop below 30% stock

The red notification badge pulses on the card corner, ensuring you never miss critical situations that need immediate attention.

### 3. ESC Key Quick Navigation
Added the ESC key as a universal shortcut to instantly return to the overview from any detail view. This joins the existing keyboard shortcuts (P, O, R, A, S, ?) to make navigation even faster. No need to click buttons - just hit ESC to get back to your main dashboard!
