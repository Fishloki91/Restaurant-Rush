# Restaurant Rush - v1.0.0 Update

## Major Feature: Day Progression System

Your restaurant now progresses through full business days! Each day lasts 3 minutes and brings new challenges as your restaurant grows in popularity. As you advance to new days, you'll notice:

- Customer orders arrive more frequently with each passing day
- You receive a 10% revenue bonus at the end of each day
- The difficulty gradually increases to keep you engaged
- Day progress is tracked and displayed in the dashboard

The day counter now shows your progress, and hovering over it reveals how far through the current day you are. Watch as your restaurant becomes busier and more challenging!

## Quality of Life Improvements

### 1. Sound Control Toggle
A new sound toggle button has been added to the control panel. While the game doesn't have audio yet, this button prepares the framework for future sound effects and music. You can toggle between sound on/off states, and the system is ready for when audio features are added.

### 2. Smart Order Sorting
Orders are now intelligently sorted to help you prioritize:
- Pending urgent orders appear first
- Orders are arranged by urgency (time remaining)
- This helps you quickly identify which orders need immediate attention
- No more scrolling to find critical orders!

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
The game now provides better visual cues:
- Hover over staff cards to see their speciality and total orders completed
- Hover over inventory items to see exact stock percentages
- Staff and inventory cards smoothly elevate on hover for better interactivity
- Tooltips provide additional context without cluttering the interface

These updates make Restaurant Rush more engaging and easier to manage, while setting the foundation for future features!
