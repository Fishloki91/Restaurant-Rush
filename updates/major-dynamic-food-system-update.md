## Quality of Life Improvements

### 1. Purchase Confirmation Warning (QOL1)
Protect yourself from risky financial decisions! A new confirmation modal alerts you before making purchases that would leave you with very low funds (at or below $0).

**How It Works:**
- Triggers when hiring staff ($150), restocking inventory ($50), or upgrading staff ($100+) would drop revenue to $0 or below
- Shows clear warning message with current and projected revenue
- Requires explicit confirmation to proceed with the purchase
- Option to cancel and preserve your funds

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental bankruptcy
- Adds strategic decision-making to resource management
- Clear visibility of financial impact before committing
- Better risk awareness for new players

Make informed financial decisions and avoid game-ending mistakes!

### 2. Multi-Staff Order Assignment (QOL2)
Tackle challenging orders faster by assigning multiple staff members to work together! The new team collaboration system lets you assign helper staff to orders already in progress.

**How It Works:**
- In-progress orders show a dropdown menu with available staff
- Select a helper and click "Add" to assign them to the order
- Each additional staff member contributes 50% of their efficiency to the order
- Multiple staff members are displayed together on the order card
- All assigned staff gain experience and performance updates when the order completes

**Strategic Uses:**
- Speed up urgent orders that are taking too long
- Handle complex multi-item orders more efficiently
- Utilize available staff during slow periods
- Train multiple staff simultaneously on the same order

**Example:** An order assigned to a 70% efficiency staff can be boosted by adding an 80% efficiency helper, giving effective 110% speed (70% + 40%)!

Maximize your team's potential through effective collaboration!

### 3. Enhanced Orders Display with Pricing & Priority (QOL3)
Get complete order information at a glance with detailed pricing and the ability to prioritize important orders!

**Individual Item Pricing:**
- Every item now shows its price: "• Beef Steak ($25)"
- Easy to see which orders are most valuable
- Better understanding of ingredient costs vs. revenue
- Helps prioritize high-value orders

**Priority System:**
- New "☆ Priority" button on every order card
- Click to prioritize/unprioritize orders
- Prioritized orders show ⭐ icon and move to the top of the list
- Gold border and subtle highlight for priority orders
- Visual feedback when toggling priority status

**Benefits:**
- Focus staff on VIP orders or high-value customers
- Never lose track of important orders
- Better order management during busy periods
- Strategic control over which orders to complete first

Complete transparency and full control over your order workflow!
